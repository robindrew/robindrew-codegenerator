# robindrew-codegenerator
Code generation is a technique increasingly common in software development. This particular API is quite extensive, but currently only generates Java code. It would be relatively straight forward, if somewhat time consuming, to add support for any object oriented language.

For a full guide to this API, please take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/robindrew/robindrew-codegenerator/wiki)
